# Uber-Analysis
In this project I did Exploratory Data Analysis on Uber Drives-2016 dataset.<br>
Further I drew some conclusions after observing the patterns and trends in the dataset.<br>
The conclusions are :
<li>The purpose for which the cabs were mostly used were business.

<li>Cabs used for business purpose mostly travelled more distance.

<li>Demand for cabs is more in the month of december.

<li>Out of all the cities considered the cabs were most used in just five cities.

<li>Majority of the cab rides were within the distance 35 km and took about 30 minutes.

<li>The cab used for Airport were usually of longer duration.
